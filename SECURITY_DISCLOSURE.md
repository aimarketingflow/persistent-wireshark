# Security Disclosure: Network Overload Protection

## Purpose of This Tool

This Persistent Wireshark Monitor was specifically created to address a critical cybersecurity vulnerability that hackers commonly exploit during network attacks.

## The Problem: Network Overload Attacks

**Hackers frequently use network overload tactics to disrupt packet capture and forensic analysis:**

- **Traffic Flooding**: Overwhelming network interfaces with excessive packets
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Consuming system memory and CPU to crash monitoring tools
- **Capture Interruption**: Forcing Wireshark to drop packets or crash entirely
- **Evidence Destruction**: Preventing security teams from collecting attack evidence

## Our Solution: Resilient Monitoring

This tool provides **robust protection against network overload attacks** through:

### üõ°Ô∏è **Anti-Disruption Features**
- **Persistent Capture**: Automatically restarts if monitoring is interrupted
- **Resource Management**: Efficient memory usage with file rotation
- **Crash Recovery**: Emergency save functionality preserves data on system failure
- **Multi-Interface Monitoring**: Distributed capture across 15+ network interfaces
- **Session Continuity**: Auto-restart maintains monitoring even after attacks

### üîí **Security Hardening**
- **Emergency Save**: Automatic data preservation on unexpected exit
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful shutdown on system interrupts
- **Session State Recovery**: Restore monitoring configuration after crashes
- **Organized Storage**: Structured file system prevents data loss

### üìä **Forensic Capabilities**
- **Complete Network Coverage**: Captures all interface types (ethernet, VPN, loopback, etc.)
- **Timestamped Sessions**: Organized evidence collection with precise timing
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed activity logs for incident analysis
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live interface statistics and capture status

## Why This Matters

Traditional Wireshark monitoring can be easily disrupted by attackers who flood the network to:
1. **Hide their activities** by overwhelming capture buffers
2. **Crash monitoring tools** through resource exhaustion
3. **Prevent evidence collection** during active attacks
4. **Create blind spots** in network security monitoring

This tool ensures **continuous monitoring capability** even under attack conditions, providing security teams with the persistent visibility needed to detect, analyze, and respond to network threats.

## Deployment Recommendation

For maximum security effectiveness, deploy this tool:
- **Before suspected attacks** to establish baseline monitoring
- **During incident response** to maintain evidence collection
- **In high-risk environments** where network attacks are anticipated
- **As part of SOC operations** for continuous threat detection
