# StealthShark Monitor Restart Fix
**Date**: 2025-08-31 16:01
**Session**: GUI Monitor Restart with Changed Options Fix

## Issue Identified
Start Monitor button didn't work after stopping and changing duration/interval settings

## Root Cause
1. **Thread reference not cleared**: `self.monitor_thread` kept old reference after stop
2. **Cached values used**: Duration/interval weren't updated from UI before starting

## Fix Applied (wireshark_monitor_gui.py)

### In `stop_monitor()`:
```python
self.monitor_thread = None  # Clear the thread reference
```

### In `start_monitor()`:
```python
# Update duration and interval from UI controls
self.update_duration()
self.update_interval()
```

## Result
✅ Monitor can now be stopped and restarted with different settings
✅ Duration changes are properly applied on restart
✅ GUI functions correctly with new parameters

## Testing Confirmed
- Started monitor with default settings
- Stopped monitor
- Changed duration to different value
- Successfully restarted with new settings
