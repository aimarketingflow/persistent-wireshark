# WiFi Security Tab Fix - October 15, 2025

## Problem
The WiFi Security tab in Multi-Interface Shark GUI was not detecting any networks because it was using the `airport` command which doesn't exist on modern macOS systems.

## Solution
Replaced the `airport -s` command with `system_profiler SPAirPortDataType` which is the standard macOS tool for WiFi information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `scan_wifi_networks()` method (lines 63-135)
- **Old**: Used `airport -s` command (non-existent)
- **New**: Uses `system_profiler SPAirPortDataType`
- Parses the "Other Local Wi-Fi Networks" section
- Extracts:
  - SSID (network name)
  - Channel (with frequency band: 2GHz, 5GHz, 6GHz)
  - Security type (WPA2, WPA3, Open, etc.)
  - Signal strength (RSSI in dBm)
  - Timestamp

### 2. Added `re` module import (line 18)
Required for regex pattern matching in channel and signal parsing.

### 3. Enhanced threat detection (lines 138-151)
- Added more suspicious SSID patterns: `'xfinitywifi'`
- Updated to handle new security values: `'Open', 'None', 'Unknown'`
- Case-insensitive SSID matching

### 4. Improved network display (lines 1036-1058)
- Better handling of security types
- Channel display formatting
- Enhanced tooltips with full details

## Testing

Created `test_wifi_scan.py` to verify functionality:
```bash
python3 test_wifi_scan.py
```

Successfully detected 26+ networks with proper:
- Security classification (🔒 WPA, 🔓 Open)
- Channel information (2GHz/5GHz/6GHz bands)
- Signal strength
- Threat detection

## How to Use

1. Launch Multi-Interface Shark GUI:
   ```bash
   python3 multi_interface_shark_gui.py
   ```

2. Navigate to **🛡️ WiFi Security** tab

3. Click **🛡️ Start WiFi Threat Detection**

4. Networks will appear within 10 seconds and refresh every 10 seconds

5. Threats are automatically flagged with popup alerts

## Network Display Format
```
🔒 NetworkName | Ch: 157 (5GHz, 80MHz) | -42dBm | WPA3 Personal
```

## Threat Detection Criteria
- Open networks with suspicious names (Free WiFi, Public, Guest, etc.)
- Very strong signals (> -30 dBm) indicating potential evil twin attacks
- Networks named "Pineapple" or similar attack tools

## Performance
- Scan interval: 10 seconds
- Timeout: 15 seconds per scan
- No impact on main network monitoring
