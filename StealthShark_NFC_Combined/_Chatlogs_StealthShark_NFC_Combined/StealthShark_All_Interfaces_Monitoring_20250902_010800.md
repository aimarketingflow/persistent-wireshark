# StealthShark NFC Combined - Enhanced Monitoring Session
**Date:** 2025-09-02
**Time:** 01:08:00 PST
**Session Focus:** Enhanced network interface monitoring and capture management

## Summary of Enhancements Completed

### 1. NFC Tag Scanning Interface Rebuild ✅
- Created new `NFCScanDialog` class with professional UI
- Added scanning progress animation and status messages
- Implemented real NFC hardware detection with fallback to simulation
- Included manual tag ID entry with auto-recognition for known patterns
- Integrated dialog into main app's NFC tag management tab

### 2. Network Monitoring Enhancements ✅
- **All Interfaces Capture:** Modified monitor to capture from ALL active network interfaces (16 total):
  - Loopback: lo0
  - Ethernet: en0, en1, en2, en3, en4, en5
  - Access Point: ap1
  - AirDrop: awdl0
  - Low Latency: llw0
  - VPN: utun0, utun1, utun2, utun3
  - Bridge: bridge0
  - Firewall: pflog0
- **Always Capture Loopback:** Ensured lo0 is always captured regardless of activity
- **Dynamic Interface Detection:** Auto-detects and captures new interfaces as they become available
- **Interface Grouping:** Organized captures by interface type for better file management

### 3. Settings Tab Implementation ✅
- Added comprehensive settings configuration tab with:
  - Custom capture directory selection
  - Auto-capture loopback toggle
  - Auto-detect new interfaces toggle
  - Capture all active interfaces option
  - Default capture duration and check interval
  - File management options (auto-cleanup, compression)
- Settings persist to `~/.stealthshark_settings.json`
- Real-time settings updates affect monitoring behavior

### 4. Capture Management Improvements ✅
- **Actual PCAP Filenames:** Updated capture table to show real PCAP filenames instead of "Unknown"
- **Session Organization:** Captures organized by session timestamp and interface group
- **File Naming Convention:** `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS-ch-{interface}.pcap`
- **Directory Structure:**
  ```
  pcap_captures/
  └── session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
      ├── loopback/
      ├── ethernet/
      ├── vpn/
      ├── airdrop/
      ├── accesspoint/
      ├── bridge/
      └── firewall/
  ```

### 5. Tab Creation Methods Restored ✅
- Fixed missing tab creation methods that were causing startup errors
- Restored all five tabs: Monitor, NFC Tags, Interfaces, Captures, Settings

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **stealthshark_nfc_combined.py**
   - Added NFCScanDialog class
   - Implemented Settings tab with full UI
   - Restored tab creation methods
   - Enhanced capture table to show actual filenames
   - Added settings load/save functionality

2. **persistent_wireshark_monitor.py**
   - Modified `monitor_interfaces()` to capture ALL up interfaces
   - Enhanced `get_interface_group()` to categorize all interface types
   - Updated `discover_interfaces()` to find all active interfaces
   - Fixed interface activity checking for broader capture

### Key Features Verified
- ✅ Capturing from all 16 active interfaces simultaneously
- ✅ Loopback interface always captured
- ✅ Dynamic interface detection working
- ✅ Settings tab functional with persistence
- ✅ Capture table shows actual PCAP filenames
- ✅ NFC scanning dialog with enhanced UX
- ✅ All tabs loading correctly

## Testing Results
- Successfully discovered 16 active network interfaces
- Captures initiated on all discovered interfaces
- Monitor thread running stably with no errors
- GUI responsive with all features functional
- Settings persisting across app restarts

## Next Steps & Recommendations
1. **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor system resources with 16+ simultaneous captures
2. **Capture Filtering:** Add interface-specific filtering options in settings
3. **Alert Thresholds:** Implement configurable alert thresholds for unusual activity
4. **Export Features:** Add bulk export of captured PCAPs with analysis
5. **Interface Profiles:** Create profiles for different monitoring scenarios

## Known Issues
- Some interfaces may fail to capture if they require special permissions
- High CPU usage possible with many active captures
- Large PCAP files may accumulate quickly with all interfaces capturing

## Dependencies
- PyQt6 for GUI
- psutil for network interface enumeration
- tcpdump for packet capture (requires sudo for some interfaces)
- Python 3.x with threading support

## Security Notes
- NFC authentication required before monitoring can start
- Captures stored locally with no encryption (consider adding)
- Some interfaces may expose sensitive traffic
